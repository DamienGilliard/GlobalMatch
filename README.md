## Benchmark Dataset
The *Tongji-Trees* dataset, as part of our work, is introduced to complement the scarce publicly available data for evaluating marker-free registration methods for forest TLS scans. The dataset (including raw scans, ground-truth matrices, and our estimated matrices) can be downloaded from either [[Google Drive](https://forms.gle/c8BXMHYTqd1iULBv8)] or [[Baidu Wangpan](https://wj.qq.com/s2/11690595/201c/)].

## Source code coming soon...
We are cleaning up the code at the moment and will release it soon. Stay tuned ;)
